## Lending Club Loan Exploration:

The purpose of this analysis was to determine whether previous applicants who applied for a loan through a Lending Club Personal Loan could predict whether a prospective applicant would be approved or denied based on refined features. Additionally, numerous loans are not paid off on time. Therefore, data obtained from the Lending Club Personal Loan database was also used to help predict whether a prospective loan applicant would pay off their loan either late or on-time.

A Machine Learning Model that focused on the features: Amount Requested, Loan Title, Debt-To-Income Ratio, State applicant resides in, and Employment Length, was utilized to determine whether an applicant would be initially approved or denied included. Furthermore, features were refined to: Recoveries, Total Late Fees Received, Total Principal Received, Total Late Payments Over the Last 2 years, FICO Score, Loan Status, and Payment Total to predict if a prospective loan applicant would pay their loan on-time or would be late with their payement.
